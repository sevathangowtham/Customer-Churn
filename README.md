Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn (i.e., customers leaving the service) using machine learning. By identifying customers likely to churn, businesses can implement retention strategies to keep them.

Objectives
Predict customer churn using machine learning models.
Identify key features that influence churn.
Methodology
Data Collection:

Used a telecommunications dataset with customer demographics, account details, and service usage.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Standardized numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions and relationships with churn.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Feature Importance:

Analyzed which features most influenced churn.
Results
Best Model: Gradient Boosting with 80% accuracy.
Important Features: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Contract Type, Internet Service.
Model Performance:
Precision: 0.68
Recall: 0.60
F1-Score: 0.64
Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting model effectively predicts customer churn. Key factors influencing churn include tenure and service-related features. This model can help businesses proactively address churn and improve customer retention.

Future Work
Improve the model with more advanced techniques.
Incorporate additional data sources.
Develop a user-friendly application for real-time churn prediction.
